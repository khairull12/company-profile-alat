# Admin Dashboard Status Report

## Current Status: âœ… RESOLVED

### Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Laravel Admin Dashboard was returning Internal Server Error (500)
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. Base Controller class was missing required traits
  2. Database column mismatch: `total_price` vs `total_amount`

### Solutions Applied
1. **Fixed Base Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php`):
   - Added missing traits: `AuthorizesRequests`, `ValidatesRequests`
   - Extended proper `BaseController` from Laravel framework

2. **Fixed Database Column References**:
   - Updated `AdminController::dashboard()` method
   - Changed `sum('total_price')` to `sum('total_amount')` to match database schema

### Test Results
âœ… **Dashboard Data Test Successful**:
- User: Admin (authenticated correctly)
- Role: admin (correct role)
- Is Admin: true (permission check working)
- Total Equipment: 7 (correct count)
- Total Bookings: 0 (correct, no bookings yet)
- Pending Bookings: 0 (correct)
- Total Users: 4 (correct)
- Monthly Revenue: 0 (correct calculation)

### Files Modified
1. `app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php` - Fixed base controller
2. `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminController.php` - Fixed column references
3. `routes/test-dashboard.php` - Created test endpoint

### Current System Status
- âœ… Laravel server running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

- âœ… Admin user exists (admin@admin.com)

### Next Steps

4. **Documentation**: Update system documentation if needed
